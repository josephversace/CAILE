IIM Platform Status Report - Post-Migration
Executive Summary
We have successfully completed the initial phase of migrating the IIM platform from a monolithic desktop application to a properly architected thin client/API server model. The system now has clear separation of concerns with the Desktop acting as a pure UI layer and the API handling all business logic.

What We've Accomplished
1. Architecture Transformation
FROM: Monolithic Desktop Application
Desktop App (Fat Client)
├── UI Components
├── Business Logic
├── Model Orchestration
├── Evidence Management
├── WSL Management
└── Direct Database Access
TO: Clean Client-Server Architecture
Desktop (Thin Client)          API Server
├── UI Components        →     ├── Business Logic
├── API Client           →     ├── Model Orchestration
└── State Management            ├── Evidence Management
                               ├── WSL Management
                               └── All Services
2. Service Organization
Created a clean, maintainable service registration pattern:
IIM.Api/Extensions/
├── ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs     # Main orchestrator
├── HttpClientExtensions.cs            # HTTP clients
├── InfrastructureServiceExtensions.cs # External systems
├── CoreServiceExtensions.cs           # Business logic
├── ApplicationServiceExtensions.cs    # App-specific
├── BackgroundServiceExtensions.cs     # Background tasks
├── CommandHandlingExtensions.cs       # Command pattern
└── AuthenticationExtensions.cs        # Auth/Security
3. Deployment Modes Implemented
The system now supports three deployment modes:

Standalone Mode (Default)

API runs locally on same machine
Full functionality for single investigator
No authentication required


Client Mode (Future)

Desktop connects to remote API
Multiple investigators share resources
Authentication required


Server Mode (Future)

API runs as central server
Admin web interface
Template-based model management




Current Data Flows
Evidence Ingestion Flow
User drags file to Desktop UI
    ↓
Desktop calls IIMApiClient.IngestEvidenceAsync()
    ↓ [HTTP POST /api/evidence/ingest]
API receives multipart form data
    ↓
SimpleMediator dispatches IngestEvidenceCommand
    ↓
AuditBehavior logs the command (chain of custody)
    ↓
EvidenceManager processes file
    ├── Calculates hash
    ├── Stores in MinIO
    ├── Deduplication check
    └── Records metadata
    ↓
Returns Evidence object with ID
    ↓
Desktop updates UI
Investigation Query Flow
User types query in Desktop UI
    ↓
Desktop calls IIMApiClient.ProcessQueryAsync()
    ↓ [HTTP POST /api/investigation/query]
API receives query
    ↓
SimpleMediator dispatches ProcessQueryCommand
    ↓
InvestigationService processes
    ├── Embeds query (via embedding service)
    ├── Searches Qdrant vector DB
    ├── Retrieves relevant documents
    ├── Generates response via LLM
    └── Adds citations
    ↓
Returns InvestigationResponse
    ↓
Desktop displays answer with citations
Model Management Flow
Desktop requests available models
    ↓ [HTTP GET /api/models/available]
API returns model list
    ↓
User selects model to load
    ↓
Desktop calls IIMApiClient.LoadModelAsync()
    ↓ [HTTP POST /api/v1/models/load]
API receives LoadModelCommand
    ↓
ModelOrchestrator loads model
    ├── Checks available memory
    ├── Downloads if needed
    ├── Loads into memory
    └── Initializes inference pipeline
    ↓
Returns success/failure

What's Working ✅
Infrastructure

✅ Clean separation between Desktop (UI) and API (business logic)
✅ Service registration using extension methods
✅ Dependency injection properly configured
✅ HTTP communication between Desktop and API
✅ SignalR hubs configured for real-time updates
✅ Health check endpoints
✅ Swagger documentation (development mode)

Core Services

✅ SimpleMediator for command/query handling
✅ Audit pipeline for critical operations
✅ WSL management endpoints
✅ Model orchestration framework
✅ Session management
✅ Evidence management structure

Storage & Persistence

✅ MinIO integration for object storage
✅ Deduplication service
✅ Storage configuration
✅ Evidence chain of custody


What's NOT Working Yet ❌
Critical Gaps

RAG Pipeline Not Connected

❌ Embedding service returns dummy data
❌ Qdrant vector search not implemented
❌ LLM generation stubbed
❌ No actual document retrieval


Model Loading Incomplete

❌ DefaultModelOrchestrator.LoadModelAsync() is stubbed
❌ No actual ONNX/Ollama integration
❌ InferencePipeline.ExecuteAsync() returns mock data


Authentication Not Implemented

❌ JWT generation not working
❌ No user management
❌ OpenIddict not configured


WSL Services

❌ Docker container management not automated
❌ Qdrant/embedding services must be started manually
❌ Health checks incomplete


Investigation Tools

❌ OCR not implemented
❌ Audio transcription stubbed
❌ Image analysis not working
❌ Entity extraction missing




Next Steps (Prioritized)
Sprint 1: Complete RAG Pipeline (1 week)
Goal: Get end-to-end document search working

Wire up Embedding Service
csharp// In RemoteEmbeddingService
- Remove stub code
- Implement actual HTTP calls to FastAPI embedding service
- Handle batching and errors

Complete Qdrant Integration
csharp// In QdrantService
- Implement CreateCollectionAsync()
- Implement UpsertAsync() for indexing
- Implement SearchAsync() for retrieval

Connect InferencePipeline
csharp// In DefaultModelOrchestrator
- Implement LoadModelAsync() with ONNX Runtime
- Wire up DirectML provider
- Handle model lifecycle

Complete Investigation Flow
csharp// In InvestigationService.ProcessQueryAsync()
- Connect all pieces: embed → search → generate
- Add citation linking
- Return real results

Model management UI
System monitoring




Testing Strategy
Current Test Coverage

❌ Unit tests: ~10% (mostly stubs)
❌ Integration tests: Not implemented
❌ E2E tests: Not implemented

Needed Tests

API Integration Tests

Evidence ingestion
Query processing
Model management


Desktop UI Tests

API client mocking
State management
Error handling




Risk Assessment
High Risk Items

Model Memory Management - Need proper resource limits
Concurrent User Access - Not tested for multi-user
Large File Processing - Streaming not fully implemented
WSL Dependency - Windows-specific, no Linux fallback

Mitigation Strategies

Implement resource quotas and monitoring
Add request queuing and rate limiting
Implement chunked upload/download
Create Docker-only deployment option


Immediate Action Items
This Week

Complete RemoteEmbeddingService - Remove stubs, add real HTTP calls
Wire up QdrantService - Implement vector operations
Test E2E flow - Evidence upload → embedding → search
Fix ModelOrchestrator - Load at least one real model

Configuration Needed
bash# Start required services
docker run -d -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
docker run -d -p 8081:8000 iim/embeddings:latest
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 minio/minio server /data
Environment Setup
json// Update appsettings.json
{
  "Development": {
    "UseInMemoryQdrant": false,  // Switch to real Qdrant
    "MockExternalServices": false  // Use real services
  }
}

Success Metrics
We'll know Phase 1 is complete when:

✅ User can upload a document
✅ Document gets embedded and indexed
✅ User can query about the document
✅ System returns accurate answer with citations
✅ All operations are audited

Current Status: Architecture complete, implementation ~40% done
Estimated Completion: 2-3 weeks for full Phase 1 functionality
